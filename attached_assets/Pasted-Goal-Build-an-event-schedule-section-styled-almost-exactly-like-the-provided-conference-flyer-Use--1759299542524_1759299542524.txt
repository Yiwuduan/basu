Goal:
Build an event schedule section styled almost exactly like the provided conference flyer. Use clean, modern typography, generous spacing, subtle dividers, and left-aligned structured blocks. The style should look editorial, minimal, and precise.

Layout Specifications

Section Container

Full width, light gray background (#f5f5f5 or similar).

Inner container centered, max width ~960px, padding top/bottom 80px, left/right 40px.

Heading Row

Large, bold title at top-left: "Conference" (or "Events" if you want literal).

Top-right space reserved for optional logo or circular badge (like "Tickets $125").

Below title, include a wide banner image (placeholder for now).

Date Range Line

Large, bold, centered text showing overall event range:
Example: "14 — 22.12.2019"

Use letterspacing and wide en-dash, all uppercase digits.

Event Rows (Core structure to replicate)

Grid layout with 3 columns:

Left Column (Location/Room): Narrow, lighter gray text, uppercase small caps.

Middle Column (Title + Date/Time): Bold title, then date/time underneath.

Right Column (Description): Regular-weight text, small size, left-aligned.

Each event row has:

Thin divider line above (except first).

Spacing: 24px padding top/bottom.

Subtext (organizers/chairs, breaks, etc.) in lighter gray, smaller font size.

Typography

Heading: Large, bold sans-serif (e.g., Helvetica Neue Bold or Inter Extra Bold).

Subtext: Lighter weight, gray (#666).

Dates/times: Monospace or bold condensed font for precision feel.

Event Blocks from Your File
Use your workshop info as the content. Here’s how it maps:

Event 1

Title: STYLE BEYOND THE MATERIAL

Date/Time: Friday Evenings (4–9pm)

Description:
Embodied Craft Studio for Girls (10–15). Upcycle your wardrobe, harness creative flow and awaken your signature style.

Studio Flow (with music journey)

Awaken the Senses: embodiment practice

Theme: story

Technical Skills: pattern drafting, garment construction, sewing, fabric technology

Organizers: Right Fit Studio

Event 2
(Optional if you have more events later in the file — coder should repeat structure for each)

Additional Details

Add subtle hover states (title underline or date highlight).

Ensure mobile responsiveness:

On small screens, collapse into vertical blocks with left column (location) stacked above main text.
